The [Leap Motion](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVYBWQO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HVYBWQO&linkCode=as2&tag=shotvideedit-20&linkId=4B2DQYALS6V3IHSB)
is a touch-less USB controller that reads your hands and fingers in the
air! Are you thinking *[Minority Report](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035WTJFW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0035WTJFW&linkCode=as2&tag=shotvideedit-20&linkId=O5RFZAG2R5VHQTQN)*?
Yeah! Well, not quite. ;-) For now, this integration functions only as a
jog/shuttle controller for Shotcut. There is much research to be done to
have effective and accurate controls for editing. Jog and shuttle is a
casual enough activity to make this fun and exciting to use nonetheless.

Configuration
-------------

You must enable **Allow Web Apps** in the Leap Motion Control Panel to
use Leap Motion with Shotcut.

Shuttle
-------

The horizontal
position of your open hand acts as a variable-speed playback control.
When your hand is left of center, it plays in reverse, and when it is
right of center, it plays forward. The further away from the center, the
faster the playback speed. Close your hand into a fist to instantly stop
or pause playback.

Jog
---

To jog means to step fowards or backwards frame-by-frame. With your hand
closed but one finger out and pointing, make small circles to step by
one frame and large circles to step second. A clockwise gesture steps
forward, and counter-clockwise steps backwards in time.

Video
-----

**NOTE**: Since the
video was made, the role of open and closed hand have been reversed.
Now, you close your hand to stop and you open your hand to enable the
controller. This makes usage more similar to the conventions of other
Leap Motion-enabled apps.

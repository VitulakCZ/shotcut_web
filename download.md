[64-bit Linux snap](https://uappexplorer.com/app/shotcut.meltytech)

On [snap-enabled systems](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install), install the
beta snap from the store with: `snap install shotcut --edge --classic`

**Linux Zip file Users**: No install required, simply extract the archive and run
it. You can drag the Shotcut folder to copy and move it wherever you
want. If double-clicking the icon in your file manager does not launch
Shotcut, open Shotcut.app, and try double-clicking the shotcut shell
script. Do not try to run bin/shotcut directly. You may need to install
the following dependencies from their distribution (the exact names may
vary): SDL, libexif, and JACK. A number of the audio filters such as
Band Pass, Bass & Treble, Compressor, Delay, Expander, High Pass, Limiter,
Low Pass, Notch, and Reverb requires that you install the SWH LADSPA plugins
package, which is commonly available in all distributions.
[Here is a page]({{ "/notes/linux-dependencies/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) that lists some required packages
for specific distributions.

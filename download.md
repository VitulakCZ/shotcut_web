[Release Notes]({{ "/download/releasenotes/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

**OS X users**: since the application is not signed, you need to
control-click the app icon and choose **Open** from the context menu the
first time you run it.

**Linux users**: no install required, simply extract the archive and run
it. You can drag the Shotcut folder to copy and move it wherever you
want. If double-clicking the icon in your file manager does not launch
Shotcut, open Shotcut.app, and try double-clicking the shotcut shell
script. Do not try to run bin/shotcut directly. You may need to install
the following dependencies from their distribution (the exact names may
vary): SDL, libexif, and JACK plus whatever LADSPA plugins you want.
[Here is a page]({{ "/notes/linux-dependencies/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) that lists some required packages
for specific distributions.

[Older versions](https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/releases/) are
available for download.

* Report problems and get usage help.
* Influence the direction of Shotcut's features.
* At least one new video tutorial a month.
* This will become a searchable knowledge-base of authoritative information about Shotcut.
* There is no advertising within the forum.
* Pay month-by-month as-needed or when upgrading, or setup a monthly recurring subscription.
* Your e-mail address is only used to send you system notifications or to contact you about your account/membership.

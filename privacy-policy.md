The Shotcut web site outside of the [forum](https://forum.shotcut.org/) does not collect or store any data - personal or
otherwise. It does not even keep logs with IP addresses and HTTP client user agent strings for basic analytics. The only
thing it does is integrate Google AdSense for serving advertisements. At that point, though, it is your web browser
communicating with Google, and you can refer to them and control your [Ads
Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).

The Shotcut Forum has its own privacy policy at https://forum.shotcut.org/privacy

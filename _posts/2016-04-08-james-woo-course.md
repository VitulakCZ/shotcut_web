Shotcut power user, James Woo, has created a wonderful
[course on how to use Shotcut](http://betterbusiness.teachable.com/courses/video-editing-course-free-shotcut?product_id=86700&coupon_code=DAN20OFF&preview=logged_out).

Currently, it contains 24 videos and costs $25, but it only costs $20 using the
coupon code in the link on this blog post! As the
lead developer of Shotcut, I reviewed the entire course, and I think it is very
good. James clearly and accurately explains many thing from basics to more
advanced techniques such as picture-in-picture, chroma keying, and using custom
HTML. The lessons are sequenced in a nice progressive manner, but you can also
directly visit specific topics. These are presented in the English language.

Version 22.03.30 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

#### Notes and Voiceover

Use the new **Notes** panel to keep notes about your project or hold text to read for a voiceover that you can record
directly to the timeline with the new **Record Audio** button on the timeline toolbar!

![Notes toolbar icon]({{ "/assets/img/blog/notes-button.png" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})
= a **Notes** panel in the **View** menu and main toolbar  
  - keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd> (<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd> on macOS).

![Record Audio icon]({{ "/assets/img/blog/record-audio-button.png" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})
= a **Record Audio** button on the **Timeline** toolbar:
  - It chooses an audio device based on either first found or last used in **Audio/Video Device**.
  - It uses the current track if it is audio and not empty at the playhead and beyond.
    Otherwise, it adds an audio track.
  - It does not prompt for a save file name when a project folder has been established.
  - Stop recording by clicking the button again.

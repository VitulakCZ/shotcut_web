  - Click toolbar button or press <kbd>M</kbd> the first time to add a marker at the playhead (current position) with no dialog.
  - Markers appear in the time ruler/track/row at the top of the **Timeline**.
  - A marker shows a tool tip with its name and time when you hover the mouse over it.
  - Click a marker to seek to it.
  - Click toolbar button or press <kbd>M</kbd> when the playhead is on the exact start time of a marker to open the **Edit** dialog where you can change the name, color, start, and end times.
  - A color change is remembered for all new markers until changed.
  - Right-click a marker to open its context menu to **Edit** or **Delete** a marker.

  - Drag a marker to move it.

  - Markers are saved to the project file.
  - Marker operations support **Undo** and **Redo**.

#### More New Stuff

- Changed the color of an alert vs. the proxy/preview-scaling status messages.
- Increased the time for some messages, and added the ability to click a message to dismiss it.
- Upgraded FFmpeg to version 4.4.1.

#### Fixes

- Fixed a CPU compatibility issue in some 21.09 versions leading to crashes on some systems:  
  v21.09.13 on all platforms &amp; v21.09.20 on Windows.
- Fixed export to MP4 or MOV may not give constant frame rate (broke in v21.09.20).
- Fixed **Properties > Speed** with GoPro `.LRV` proxy file (broke in v21.09.20).
- Fixed **Export > Reset** did not deselect a preset.

[Glaxnimate](https://glaxnimate.mattbas.org/) is a 2D vector drawing and animation program that is now integrated
and bundled with Shotcut:

- Added support for reading Lottie and rawr JSON animation formats as a clip.
- Added **Open Other > Animation** to make a new drawing or animation.
- Added a **Mask: Draw (Glaxnimate)** video filter.
- Preview the Shotcut timeline within Glaxnimate.
- Known issues:
  - Preview on macOS may stop working due to out-of-resources until reboot.
  - Some Lottie animations make export fail. The one that I have a problem with shows warnings upon opening in Glaxnimate.
  - See also Glaxnimate's [bug tracker](https://gitlab.com/mattbas/glaxnimate/-/issues)

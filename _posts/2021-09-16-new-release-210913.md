Version 21.09.13 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**](https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/releases/tag/v21.09.13)!

This main purpose of this version is to fix a major new bug in previous version 21.08. We hope for this to become the
new recommended stable version.

- Fixed dragging to **Timeline** broken if there is MLT XML on the clipboard (broke v21.08.29).
- Fixed seeking backwards after seeking to the end (broke in v21.08.29).
- Fixed **File > Save** (Ctrl-S) immediately after **File > Close** (Ctrl-W) can corrupt a saved project.
- Fixed **Add Custom Video Mode > Frames/sec** was not accepting some legitimate values.
- Fixed encoding HEVC without hardware encoder (x265) would always output 10-bit instead of 8 (broke in v20.11.28).
- Changed **Copy the filters** to only copy enabled filters.
- Changed fading on the Timeline to automatically fade the opacity when it is not the bottom video track.
- Expire old QML cache items at startup to reduce app data footprint.
- Improved performance of **360:** video filters.
- Added **360: Equirectangular to Stereographic** video filter. 
  This can be used to create so-called Tiny Planet videos.
